here is my budget turbo miata parts formula.

Parts listed are for a 1.8L build, adjust parts for 1.6 as needed. Should be capable of more power than what the rods are good for and should do so for less than $2,000. Dyno tune to 220whp and stop. Only missing parts here are downpipe and exhaust. Take to exhaust shop for finalization. I would do everything but the turbo, turbo manifold, and boost controller on a supercharged build.

- turbo manifold	https://amzn.to/2O9ofi4
- gt2860 (internally gated)	https://amzn.to/3jioJhg
- clutch	https://amzn.to/3rmQ6tf - stock one might hold if you are nice to it but why bother?
- oil line kit	https://amzn.to/3jrtlSs
- diypnp megasquirt	https://www.diyautotune.com/product/diypnp-nippon-denso-76pin-unassembled-kit/ - you can spend extra and get the pre-built kit if you want
- wideband o2 sensor	https://amzn.to/36JEMjj
- colder turbo spark plugs	http://amzn.to/2wk5s9z
- injectors	https://amzn.to/2MXmXpS
- radiator	https://amzn.to/2O7Uv5c
- bov adapter	http://amzn.to/2wkgA6w
- knock off bov	http://amzn.to/2fVPT0N
- intercooler	http://amzn.to/2fV6emw
- intercooler pipe kit	http://amzn.to/2fVbSFf
- boost controller	http://amzn.to/2ifbjGQ - without this you should be somewhere around 180whp with proper tuning
