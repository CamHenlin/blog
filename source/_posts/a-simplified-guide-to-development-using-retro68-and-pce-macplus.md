I started playing around using [Retro68](https://amzn.to/3omPX7Z) on a modern Linux-based machine to do development work for old Macintosh computers in the spirit of [one of my previous posts](/2021/02/11/technical-things-i-would-work-on-if-i-had-unlimited-time/).

I used a few other guides to build up to what I ultimately wound up using for my development workflow:

- http://www.toughdev.com/content/2018/12/developing-68k-mac-apps-with-codelite-ide-retro68-and-pce-macplus-emulator/ - this is hands down the best guide I have seen and what I base most of this workflow on
